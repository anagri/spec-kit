# Feature Specification: Constitution Command Clarification Flow

**Feature ID**: `001-when-the-user`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "when the user gives the `/constitution` command with minimal details, then the command still generates a minimal but a very hallucinated constitution, assuming many things that the user never mentioned. Given constitution is a guiding document and is consulted very often, such an approach is error-prone. As part of the /constitution command, After we have thought through what the user provided as input and we need either clarification or confirmation on decisions, then we go back to the user with the list of questions and options if applicable. So that the user can provide us with further details and we are able to generate a more concise and approved constitution. Check the existing /plan command where we use the need clarification tag and go back to the user seeking clarification. Instead of /clarify being a separate step, For the /constitution, we will not generate the constitution till the user has provided sufficient details around it. It does not have to be 100% complete, but it should not also be generated without user input."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05

- Q: When `/constitution` command receives empty or minimal input, what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Generate minimal constitution with all sections marked [NEEDS CLARIFICATION], then inform user input is insufficient and suggest running `/clarify` to provide clarifications

- Q: How should `/clarify` handle user disagreement with AI's interpretation? ‚Üí A: User can attempt to make AI understand through rephrasing; if unsuccessful, user has flexibility to modify the constitution file directly. The `/clarify` command will go through all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] blocks giving user option to provide clarification for each.

- Q: Should there be a maximum limit on clarification iterations, or allow unlimited `/clarify` runs until user is satisfied? ‚Üí A: Soft limit (e.g., 3 rounds) - warn user after threshold but allow continuation

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extracted: /constitution command improvement, clarification workflow
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users creating constitutions, AI generating constitution
   ‚Üí Actions: Provide minimal input, request clarification, approve details
   ‚Üí Data: Constitution principles, clarification questions
   ‚Üí Constraints: No generation without user input, similar to /plan flow
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What constitutes "minimal" vs "sufficient" input?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should existing /plan clarification logic be reused?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How many rounds of clarification are acceptable?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Scenario defined for minimal input ‚Üí clarification ‚Üí approved constitution
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Requirements marked for clarification workflow
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Entities: Constitution, Clarification Question, User Response
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding clarification thresholds"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications addressed)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user setting up a new project with spec-kit, I want to create a constitution that accurately reflects my project's principles without AI making incorrect assumptions, so that the constitution serves as a reliable guiding document throughout development.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user runs `/constitution` with minimal description (e.g., "Python web app"),
   **When** the AI analyzes the input,
   **Then** the AI MUST generate a minimal constitution with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers and inform user to run `/clarify-constitution` for constitution-specific questions

2. **Given** a user runs `/clarify-constitution` after generating an incomplete constitution,
   **When** the `/clarify-constitution` command processes the constitution,
   **Then** the AI MUST ask constitution-specific clarification questions (principles, tech stack, workflow, governance)

3. **Given** the AI has presented clarification questions via `/clarify-constitution`,
   **When** the user provides answers and confirmations,
   **Then** the AI MUST update the constitution incorporating the user's specific inputs without hallucinating additional principles

4. **Given** a user runs `/constitution` with comprehensive details,
   **When** the AI determines sufficient information is provided,
   **Then** the AI MAY generate the constitution with minimal or no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers

5. **Given** the user provides partial answers during `/clarify-constitution`,
   **When** critical information is still missing,
   **Then** remaining sections MUST retain [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] tags until addressed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user provides no description at all (just `/constitution`)?
  ‚Üí System generates minimal template constitution with all sections marked [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

- How does system handle user abandoning clarification (not responding)?
  ‚Üí Constitution remains with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers; user can run `/clarify-constitution` again later

- What if user disagrees with AI's interpretation during clarification?
  ‚Üí User can attempt to rephrase/explain to help AI understand; if unsuccessful, user can directly edit the constitution file

- How many clarification rounds before forcing generation?
  ‚Üí Soft limit approach: After threshold (e.g., 3 rounds), warn user but allow continuation; no forced generation

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST analyze user input to `/constitution` command and determine if sufficient details are provided

- **FR-002**: System MUST generate a minimal constitution with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers when user input is insufficient, covering:
  - Core architectural principles
  - Technology constraints
  - Development workflow preferences
  - Governance policies

- **FR-003**: System MUST inform user when generated constitution is incomplete and suggest running `/clarify-constitution` to provide missing details

- **FR-004**: `/clarify-constitution` command MUST be a separate command dedicated to constitution clarification (keeps spec and constitution flows separate)

- **FR-005**: `/clarify-constitution` command MUST generate constitution-specific questions, asking about:
  - Architectural principles (e.g., test-first, library-first, CLI-only)
  - Technology constraints (language, frameworks, platforms)
  - Development workflow (solo vs team, branching strategy, release process)
  - Governance policies (amendment process, compliance, versioning)

- **FR-006**: System MUST incorporate user's clarification responses from `/clarify-constitution` into the constitution, replacing [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers with concrete details

- **FR-007**: `/clarify-constitution` command MUST follow similar interaction pattern to `/clarify` for specs (same question format, same iterative workflow)

- **FR-010**: `/clarify-constitution` command MUST iterate through all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] blocks in the constitution, giving user option to provide clarification for each block

- **FR-011**: System MUST support user directly editing constitution file when AI misinterprets clarification responses (escape hatch for communication failures)

- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to run `/clarify-constitution` multiple times to iteratively refine the constitution without restarting

- **FR-012**: System MUST implement soft iteration limit (e.g., 3 rounds) that warns user when threshold is reached but allows continuation of clarification process

- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve user-provided constitution content when running `/clarify-constitution` again (only update sections that were clarified, don't regenerate entire document)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Constitution**: The governance document containing principles, enforcement rules, and governance policies; may have sections marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] tags

- **Clarification Question**: A specific question posed to the user about missing constitutional information; includes context, suggested options, and section reference

- **User Response**: User's answer to a clarification question during `/clarify-constitution`; updates specific constitution sections

- **Clarification Session**: A conversation thread between user and AI via `/clarify-constitution` to gather constitutional details; tracks which sections have been clarified vs remain incomplete

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Constitution generation MUST NOT hallucinate or assume principles not mentioned by user

- **NFR-002**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers MUST be removed only when user explicitly provides information, not by AI inference

- **NFR-003**: `/clarify-constitution` command MUST be implemented as a separate command that does not affect the existing `/clarify` workflow for specs
