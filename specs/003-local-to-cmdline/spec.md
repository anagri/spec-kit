# Feature Specification: Local Development Mode for Template Distribution

**Feature ID**: `003-to-command-line`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "to command line, add a flag --local <path> That takes in the path to the local spec-kit repo, and then instead of downloading the artifacts from the `GitHub` releases, it looks into the folders in the repo instead. note that the source folder changes, if downloading from releases, we have .claude/commands from releases, but have templates/commands in the repo, .specify/memory,scripts,templates in releases but these folders are on top in repo"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature adds local development mode via --local flag
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: CLI users, developers
   ‚Üí Actions: Initialize project from local repo
   ‚Üí Data: File paths, template sources
   ‚Üí Constraints: Path mapping (source vs release structure)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED] Path structure differences documented in input
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary: Developer testing template changes without release
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements testable via CLI invocations
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Path mappings, source locations
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No tech details leaked, focused on user needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07
- Q: When validating the local path, if only some required directories exist (e.g., templates/ and scripts/ present, but memory/ missing), what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Fail validation entirely - all three directories must exist
- Q: When copying from scripts/bash/, should the system copy only files directly in that directory, or also include subdirectories and their contents recursively? ‚Üí A: Recursive copy - all subdirectories and files
- Q: If the local repository contains symbolic links in template/script directories, what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Follow symlinks - copy target file contents

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a **spec-kit developer**, when I make changes to templates, scripts, or memory files, I need to test those changes in a real project initialization **without creating a GitHub release**, so I can validate my changes work correctly before publishing.

Currently, developers must create releases to test template changes, which is slow and pollutes the release history with test versions.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I have a local spec-kit repository with modified templates, **When** I run `speclaude init my-project --local /path/to/spec-kit`, **Then** the project should initialize using templates from my local repository instead of downloading from GitHub

2. **Given** I have modified a bash script in `scripts/bash/`, **When** I initialize with `--local`, **Then** the initialized project should contain my modified script in `.specify/scripts/bash/`

3. **Given** I have modified a slash command template in `templates/commands/`, **When** I initialize with `--local`, **Then** the initialized project should contain my modified command in `.claude/commands/`

4. **Given** I provide an invalid local path, **When** I run `speclaude init --local /invalid/path`, **Then** the CLI should show a clear error message explaining the path doesn't exist or isn't a valid spec-kit repository

7. **Given** the local repository has a subdirectory under `scripts/bash/utils/`, **When** I initialize with `--local`, **Then** the initialized project should contain `.specify/scripts/bash/utils/` with all files preserved

8. **Given** the local repository has a symlinked file in `templates/`, **When** I initialize with `--local`, **Then** the symlink target contents should be copied (not the symlink itself)

5. **Given** I use `--local` flag, **When** initialization completes, **Then** no network requests should be made to GitHub (no download, no API calls)

6. **Given** I use both `--local` and existing project path, **When** I run `speclaude init existing-dir --local /path/to/spec-kit`, **Then** the behavior should match current rules (error if directory exists, unless using `--here` with confirmation)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the local repository is missing required directories (templates/, scripts/, memory/)?
  ‚Üí System MUST fail validation and show clear error listing which directories are missing

- What happens when local path is relative vs absolute?
  ‚Üí System should support both, resolving relative paths from current working directory

- What happens when using `--local` with `--here` or `--no-git` flags?
  ‚Üí All flags should work together normally; --local only affects source of templates

- What happens when local repository has uncommitted changes?
  ‚Üí System should use whatever files exist, regardless of git status (developer testing scenario)

- What happens when the local repository contains symbolic links?
  ‚Üí System MUST follow symlinks and copy the target file contents (symlinks are dereferenced)

- What happens when copying subdirectories from scripts/bash/?
  ‚Üí System MUST copy all subdirectories recursively, maintaining directory structure

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a new `--local` flag with a path argument on the `init` command

- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that the provided local path exists and is accessible

- **FR-003**: System MUST validate that the local path contains ALL three required directories: `templates/`, `scripts/`, and `memory/`. Validation MUST fail if any directory is missing

- **FR-004**: When `--local` is provided, system MUST skip GitHub release API calls entirely

- **FR-005**: When `--local` is provided, system MUST skip template download from GitHub

- **FR-006**: System MUST copy template files from `<local-path>/templates/` (excluding commands/) to `.specify/templates/` in the target project, including all subdirectories recursively

- **FR-007**: System MUST copy bash scripts from `<local-path>/scripts/bash/` to `.specify/scripts/bash/` in the target project, including all subdirectories and their contents recursively

- **FR-008**: System MUST copy memory files from `<local-path>/memory/` to `.specify/memory/` in the target project, including all subdirectories recursively

- **FR-009**: System MUST copy slash command templates from `<local-path>/templates/commands/` to `.claude/commands/` in the target project, including all subdirectories recursively

- **FR-010**: System MUST apply the same template processing (placeholder substitution, path rewriting) when using local templates as when using downloaded templates

- **FR-011**: System MUST resolve relative paths in `--local` argument relative to the current working directory

- **FR-012**: System MUST accept absolute paths in `--local` argument

- **FR-013**: System MUST display clear error messages when local path is invalid or incomplete

- **FR-014**: System MUST continue to support all existing flags (`--here`, `--no-git`, `--force`, `--ignore-agent-tools`, etc.) when using `--local`

- **FR-015**: System MUST set executable permissions on copied bash scripts when using `--local` (same as release mode)

- **FR-017**: When copying files, system MUST follow symbolic links and copy the target file contents (symlinks are resolved, not preserved)

- **FR-016**: Progress tracker MUST show "Using local templates" instead of "Downloading from GitHub" when `--local` is active

### Key Entities

- **Local Repository Path**: The file system location of a spec-kit repository containing source templates, scripts, and memory files
  - Attributes: absolute or relative path
  - Validation: Must exist, must be directory, must contain expected subdirectories

- **Source Directory Mapping**: The relationship between repository source structure and release structure
  - Repository structure: `templates/`, `scripts/bash/`, `memory/`, `templates/commands/`
  - Release structure: `.specify/templates/`, `.specify/scripts/bash/`, `.specify/memory/`, `.claude/commands/`
  - Mapping rules:
    - `templates/*.md` ‚Üí `.specify/templates/*.md` (exclude commands/)
    - `templates/commands/*.md` ‚Üí `.claude/commands/*.md`
    - `scripts/bash/*.sh` ‚Üí `.specify/scripts/bash/*.sh`
    - `memory/*` ‚Üí `.specify/memory/*`

- **Template Source**: Abstraction representing where templates come from
  - Types: "GitHub Release" (default) or "Local Repository" (with --local flag)
  - Behavior changes based on type (download vs copy)
