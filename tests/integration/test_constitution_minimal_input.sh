## Core Principles

### I. Architectural Principle
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Rationale**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

### II. Technology Stack
**Language**: Python [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: version]
**Framework**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: FastAPI vs Django vs Flask]

## Development Workflow
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: solo vs team, branching strategy]

## Governance
**Amendment Process**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Versioning**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-05
